# SkillGap-PCA Final Project

# 🚀 SkillGap-PCA  
### Skill Gap Detection & Curriculum Optimization using PCA

SkillGap-PCA is an end-to-end **Machine Learning project** that identifies **skill gaps between industry demand and student supply** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
It also provides **curriculum optimization insights** and a **student-facing skill gap checker** via an interactive dashboard.

## 📌 Problem Statement
With rapidly changing industry requirements, academic curricula often lag behind, leading to a **skill mismatch** among graduates.

This project aims to:
- Detect **high-demand but low-supply skills**
- Analyze curriculum coverage using **CLO mapping**
- Quantify **student skill gaps**
- Provide **visual and interpretable insights** using PCA
